## Secure Enclave Failure via Shared I2C4 Bus in Apple A17 Pro 

## Overview

This repository documents a hardware-level security vulnerability in Apple's A17 Pro SoC (D84AP), affecting the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The issue arises from a shared I2C4 bus between two critical components:

* The Secure Enclave Processor (SPU)
* The digitizer controller

A fault or degradation on I2C4 causes the SPU to remain stuck in SecureROM, disabling critical cryptographic and biometric services. Despite this failure, the system continues to boot normally — without alerting the user, enforcing SEP protections, or triggering failsafe behavior.

## Key Findings

* Devices enter a silent, insecure boot state when I2C4 is degraded.
* The Secure Enclave does not initialize; SEP drivers fail to load.
* iOS boots normally, but cryptographic enforcement is silently disabled.
* Keychain, CoreTelephony, and storage subsystems fall back to insecure states (e.g., NoEncryption).
* Encrypted push messaging services are downgraded to opportunistic.
* There is no recovery via DFU, OTA, or OS patch — the issue is hardware-bound.

## Impact Summary

Type: Hardware Security Bypass
Affected Chipset: Apple A17 Pro (D84AP)
Device: iPhone 15 Pro Max
Trigger: Electrical degradation or fault on I2C4 (e.g., brown-out)
Impact:

* Secure Enclave permanently unavailable
* Biometric authentication and keybag services disabled
* Data protection silently bypassed
* No user-visible indication of degraded security posture

## Proof of Concept

Captured logs from affected hardware confirm SPU and digitizer failure, as well as fallback behavior in key services:

```
aoprose: PRRose::setStateFromUnknownToHost: FWState::SecureROM
AppleSPU::_handleReadyReport, serviceName (arc-eeprom-i2c)
Couldn't alloc class "AppleSPULogDriver"
Couldn't alloc class "AppleSPUGestureDriver"
RawI2C slave presence test: 6265
_enableControlI2C currentControlReg = 0x60
IOHIDEventDriver: Invalid digitizer transducer
AppleSphinxProxHIDEventDriver: Invalid digitizer transducer
```

Additional system logs reveal cryptographic fallback and loss of encryption enforcement:

```
CommCenter: Bootstrapping EncryptedIdentityManagement
bluetoothd: _BTKCGetDataCopy found keychain item ... result 0
SYDStoreConfiguration: storeID=com.apple.coretelephony type=NoEncryption
handle_mount: vol-uuid ... (unencrypted; flags: 0x1)
apsd: recategorizing topic com.apple.private.alloy.continuity.encryption from none to opportunistic
```

These logs show:

* SEP-backed drivers fail to allocate, indicating SPU init failure.
* Core services such as CoreTelephony explicitly fall back to `NoEncryption`.
* The user data partition mounts without full protection class enforcement.
* Encrypted Apple push topics are downgraded due to the lack of SEP identity keys.

## Recommendations

For Silicon Engineering:

* Redesign future SoCs (e.g., A18, M4) to avoid single-bus coupling between SPU and peripherals.
* Provide redundant or fail-safe access paths for SEP initialization data.
* Enforce SecureROM policy that halts boot or triggers a user-visible alert if SPU fails to initialize.

For Platform Security:

* Instrument boot chain to detect and report SPU failures in real time.
* Prevent fallback to insecure keychain or storage modes without user awareness.
* Log all transitions to `NoEncryption` states and disable biometric fallback if SEP is offline.

## Disclosure Status

* Report submitted via Apple Security 
* Awaiting triage or feedback
* This repository is intended for research transparency, peer review, and responsible disclosure coordination
